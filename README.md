# NEW Build from Source.

1. Get new docker and install common packages.

```
apt update
apt install build-essential wget patch unzip vim git
```

2. Install opam 1.2.2 and init.

```
wget https://github.com/ocaml/opam/releases/download/1.2.2/opam-1.2.2-x86_64-Linux
install opam-1.2.2-x86_64-Linux /usr/local/bin/opam
opam init --comp=4.02.3
eval `opam config env`
```

3. Install additional opam deps:

```
opam depext conf-autoconf.0.1
opam depext conf-m4.1
opam depext camlzip.1.05
```

4. Install java 8_151:

```
# Download from https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html
# outside docker
docker cp ./jdk-8u151-linux-x64.tar.gz footpatch:/root/
# inside docker
mkdir -p /usr/lib/jvm
tar zxvf jdk-8u151-linux-x64.tar.gz -C /usr/lib/jvm
sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" "java" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_151/bin/java" 1
sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/javac" "javac" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_151/bin/javac" 1
sudo update-alternatives --set java /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_151/bin/java
sudo update-alternatives --set javac /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.8.0_151/bin/javac
```

5. Install FootPatch:

```
git clone https://github.com/yuntongzhang/footpatch.git
cd footpatch/
./SETUP.sh
```


# VM Download

The [Footpatch VM is hosted on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3440280#.XYUJSpNKiu4). The username/password is **vagrant/vagrant**.

# Build from source

If you just want to play with running footpatch (and possibly hacking at the code),
use the [VM](#vm-download). Dependencies for olders versions of Infer can (and have) broken or
disappeared, and can cause building from source to be problematic.

If you really want to build from source, here is some guidance.
Building is only tested on Ubuntu 14.04 and Infer v0.9.3. There is
no support for other versions of Infer at this time. Install the [dependencies](#dependencies)

If you have all the dependencies installed, running `./SETUP.sh` should be
enough.


# Dependencies

You need at least the following dependencies:

```
# install opam
add-apt-repository ppa:avsm/ppa
apt-get update
apt-get install opam

# additional deps
opam depext conf-autoconf.0.1
opam depext conf-m4.1
opam depext camlzip.1.05

# java
sudo apt-get install default-jdk
sudo apt-get install default-jre

```

For projects tested, you need to do at least:

```

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade libstdc++6

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
sudo apt-get install gradle

sudo apt-get install clang
sudo apt-get install subversion
```

## Known good package versions

These package versions are known to be good for the source build release, but
may have updated constraints in opam that make it hard to obtain this configuration.
